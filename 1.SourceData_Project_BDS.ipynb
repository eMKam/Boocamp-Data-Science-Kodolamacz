    "PolitiFact.com is a fact-checking website that rates the accuracy of claims by elected officials and others on its Truth-O-Meter. PolitiFact.com is a nonprofit project operated by the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Florida, with offices there and in Washington, D.C. It began in 2007 as a project of the Tampa Bay Times (then the St. Petersburg Times), with reporters and editors from the newspaper and its affiliated news media partners reporting on the accuracy of statements made by elected officials, candidates, their staffs, lobbyists, interest groups and others involved in U.S. politics. Its journalists evaluate original statements and publish their findings on the PolitiFact.com website, where each statement receives a \"Truth-O-Meter\" rating. The ratings range from \"True\" for completely accurate statements to \"Pants on Fire\" (from the taunt \"Liar, liar, pants on fire\") for false and ludicrous claims.\n",
